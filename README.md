# Feed Reader Testing

For this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was already included, as was the starter code for the first tests. My task was to complete the project by implementing the requirements given below.


## How to run the application

1. Clone the repository with $git clone https://github.com/ashton-martin/feed-reader-testing.git
2. Open index.html in the browser. This will display both the page and the Jasmine test suites (scroll to the bottom of the browser).



## How were the tests evaluated?

The following tasks were mandatory:

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not      empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not    empty.
3. Write a new test suite named "The menu".
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine      how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two        
   expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".
7. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry  
   element within the .feed container.
8. Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".
9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
